Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 \u03bcg of epinephrine was used.

Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized.\nIn situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia.

In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\nWhen spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized.\nIn situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care.\nA 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 \u03bcg of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\nWhen spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized.\nIn situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia.

Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care.\nA 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 \u03bcg of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes.

By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources.

The trigger for maturation is the secretion of brain-derived neuropeptides, yet the mechanisms controlling the timely onset of this event remain ill-defined. Here, we show that a regulatory feedback circuit controlling the Drosophila prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) neuropeptide triggers maturation onset. We identify the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in the PTTH-expressing neurons (PTTHn) as a regulator of developmental maturation onset. Loss of EcR in these PTTHn impairs PTTH signaling, which delays maturation. We find that the steroid ecdysone dose-dependently affects Ptth transcription, promoting its expression at lower concentrations while inhibiting it at higher concentrations. Our findings indicate the existence of a feedback circuit in which rising ecdysone levels trigger, via EcR activity in the PTTHn, the PTTH surge that generates the maturation-inducing ecdysone peak toward the end of larval development. Because steroid feedback is also known to control the vertebrate maturation-inducing hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, our findings suggest an overall conservation of the feedback-regulatory neuroendocrine circuitry that times maturation initiation.",

The survey was self-administered through email delivery to practicing members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.\nOf 349 respondents, the majority were attending physicians in private practice and used SC 25% to 50% of the time. There was a higher rate of SC use by clinicians in the Southeast United States (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.10; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 1.18-3.72) and by those in private practice (aOR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.63-4.37). Levels of SC knowledge did not vary across respondents; however, knowledge was associated with increased use of SC. Only 62.8% of respondents answered all 4 Knowledge questions correctly and this was associated with a 3.5-fold decrease in SC use (aOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.44). Attitudes toward SC use reflected prescribing practices and were also linked to levels of knowledge, as respondents with less knowledge were more likely to have a favorable outlook toward use of SC.\nUse of SC for treatment of acute URTI is associated with clinician demographics and knowledge. Otolaryngologists are more likely to use SC for acute URTI in the Southeast United States and in private practice. Knowledge and provider education are key factors in prescribing patterns.",

Here, we show that a regulatory feedback circuit controlling the Drosophila prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) neuropeptide triggers maturation onset. We identify the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in the PTTH-expressing neurons (PTTHn) as a regulator of developmental maturation onset.

We find that the steroid ecdysone dose-dependently affects Ptth transcription, promoting its expression at lower concentrations while inhibiting it at higher concentrations. Our findings indicate the existence of a feedback circuit in which rising ecdysone levels trigger, via EcR activity in the PTTHn, the PTTH surge that generates the maturation-inducing ecdysone peak toward the end of larval development. Because steroid feedback is also known to control the vertebrate maturation-inducing hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, our findings suggest an overall conservation of the feedback-regulatory neuroendocrine circuitry that times maturation initiation.",

Also interviewed were 56 contraceptive purchasers and 51 purchasers of injectables contraceptives intended for use as abortifacients who were recruited at the participating pharmacies.

Data from national surveys in 1977 and 1987 permit a comparison of sources of contraceptive supplies before and after the elimination of government support for family planning. The purchase of pseudo-abortifacients from private pharmacies was used as an indication of induced abortion. After the loss of government clinics, it is suggested that some women turned to pharmacists to obtain pseudo-abortifacients when faced with unwanted pregnancy. There is an indication of increased pseudo-abortifacient use, particularly among unmarried women and those from poorer neighbourhoods.\nThe hypothesis that a restriction of family planning services will be associated with an increased incidence of abortion was investigated in a survey carried out in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1985.  In 1979, the Government of Paraguay abruptly eliminated all support for family planning services at Ministry of Health clinics--a measure that affected at least half of all contraceptive acceptors and forced them to turn to pharmacies for contraceptive supplies.  The survey, which samples 10% of the registered private pharmacies in Asuncion, used the sale of pseudo- abortifacients as a measure of induced abortion.  Also interviewed were 56 contraceptive purchasers and 51 purchasers of injectables contraceptives intended for use as abortifacients who were recruited at the participating pharmacies.  The results indicated that low-income women were 5 times more likely than their higher income counterparts to purchase pseudo-abortifacients.  In addition, unmarried women were 3 times more likely to purchase progestogen injections to induce a missed menstrual period than married women.  Almost 70% of abortifacient purchasers reported that they had attempted to self-abort on previous occasions.  The pharmacists stated that up to 50 women a week requested medication for pregnancy termination and were in agreement that this practice had increased substantially following the government's withdrawal of support for contraception.  The pharmacists expressed concern about the nonavailability of counseling from trained family planning personnel and indicated that some pharmacy staff knowingly exploit women by injecting them with unsafe preparations or drugs that cannot induce abortion.  The administration of ineffective pseudo-abortifacients can delay the decision to seek an illegal abortion or result in life-threatening incomplete abortion.",

Among them are numerous illegal websites selling medicine without valid medical prescriptions or distributing substandard or counterfeit drugs. Only a limited number of studies have been published on Internet pharmacies with regard to patient safety, professionalism, long-term follow-up, and pharmaceutical legitimacy verification.\nIn this study, we selected, evaluated, and followed 136 Internet pharmacy websites aiming to identify indicators of professional online pharmacy service and online medication safety.\nAn Internet search was performed by simulating the needs of potential customers of online pharmacies. A total of 136 Internet pharmacy websites were assessed and followed for four years. According to the LegitScript database, relevant characteristics such as longevity, time of continuous operation, geographical location, displayed contact information, prescription requirement, medical information exchange, and pharmaceutical legitimacy verification were recorded and evaluated.\nThe number of active Internet pharmacy websites decreased; 23 of 136 (16.9%) online pharmacies ceased operating within 12 months and only 67 monitored websites (49.3%) were accessible at the end of the four-year observation period. However, not all operated continuously, as about one-fifth (31/136) of all observed online pharmacy websites were inaccessible provisionally. Thus, only 56 (41.2%) Internet-based pharmacies were continuously operational. Thirty-one of the 136 online pharmacies (22.8%) had not provided any contact details, while only 59 (43.4%) displayed all necessary contact information on the website. We found that the declared physical location claims did not correspond to the area of domain registration (according to IP address) for most websites. Although the majority (120/136, 88.2%) of the examined Internet pharmacies distributed various prescription-only medicines, only 9 (6.6%) requested prior medical prescriptions before purchase. Medical information exchange was generally ineffective as 52 sites (38.2%) did not require any medical information from patients. The product information about the medicines was generally (126/136, 92.6%) not displayed adequately, and the contents of the patient information leaflet were incomplete in most cases (104/136, 76.5%). Numerous online operators (60/136, 44.1%) were defined as rogue Internet pharmacies, but no legitimate Internet-based pharmacies were among them. One site (0.7%) was yet unverified, 23 (16.9%) were unapproved, while the remaining (52/136, 38.2%) websites were not available in the LegitScript database. Contrary to our prior assumptions, prescription or medical information requirement, or the indication of contact information on the website, does not seem to correlate with \"rogue pharmacy\" status using the LegitScript online pharmacy verification standards. Instead, long-term continuous operation strongly correlated (P<.001) with explicit illegal activity.\nMost Internet pharmacies in our study sample were illegal sites within the definition of \"rogue\" Internet pharmacy. These websites violate professional, legal, and ethical standards and endanger patient safety. This work shows evidence that online pharmacies that act illegally appear to have greater longevity than others, presumably because there is no compelling reason for frequent change in order to survive. We also found that one in five websites revived (closed down and reopened again within four years) and no-prescription sites with limited medicine and patient information are flourishing.",

The changes in etiology and demographic of the disease, which now includes also a large proportion of iatrogenic conditions, has prompted new studies and updates in the guideline for IE treatment. The increasing use of intravascular and intracardiac devices has introduced new challenges in terms of both antibiotic resistance and surgical treatment of prosthetic endocarditis. Also, patients with complex congenital heart diseases, intravenous drug abusers and patients with chronic renal failure under hemodialysis have been added to the list of high-risk subjects for IE. Important aspects concerning the establishment of the endocarditis team, the clinical management, the optimal medical therapy and the indication and timing for surgery are arguments of debate and controversy across the literature. In particular, the most adequate strategy to be adopted in the context of concomitant neurological complication remains greatly debated. Despite attempts to standardize the practice in IE, the lack of powered randomized clinical evidence prevented the achievement of a univocal consensus in several aspects of the management of IE. This situation reflects in some differences in the recommendation promoted by the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. In this review, we will compare the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines and discuss important aspects related to clinical management and indications of for treatment.",

According to the recently updated guidelines, IVT should be administered in absence of absolute exclusion criteria. We aimed to assess the proportion of ischemic strokes potentially eligible and actually treated with IVT, and to explore the reasons for not administering IVT. We prospectively collected and analyzed data from 1184 consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to the 22 Stroke Units (SUs) of the Veneto region from September 18th to December 10th 2017. Patients were treated with IVT according to the current Italian guidelines. For untreated patients, the reasons for not administering IVT were reported by each center in a predefined model including absolute and/or relative exclusion criteria and other possible reasons. Out of 841 (71%) patients who presented within 4.5\u00a0h of stroke onset, 704 (59%) had no other absolute exclusion criteria and were therefore potentially eligible for IVT according to the current guidelines. However, only 323 (27%) patients were eventually treated with IVT. Among 861 (73%) untreated patients, 480 had at least one absolute exclusion criterion, 283 only relative exclusion criteria, 56 only other reasons, and 42 a combination of relative exclusion criteria and other reasons. Our study showed that only 46% (323/704) of the potentially eligible patients were actually treated with IVT in the SUs of the Veneto region. All healthcare professionals involved in the acute stroke pathway should make an effort to bridge this gap between eligibility and reality.",

Although the majority (120/136, 88.2%) of the examined Internet pharmacies distributed various prescription-only medicines, only 9 (6.6%) requested prior medical prescriptions before purchase. Medical information exchange was generally ineffective as 52 sites (38.2%) did not require any medical information from patients. The product information about the medicines was generally (126/136, 92.6%) not displayed adequately, and the contents of the patient information leaflet were incomplete in most cases (104/136, 76.5%). Numerous online operators (60/136, 44.1%) were defined as rogue Internet pharmacies, but no legitimate Internet-based pharmacies were among them. One site (0.7%) was yet unverified, 23 (16.9%) were unapproved, while the remaining (52/136, 38.2%) websites were not available in the LegitScript database. Contrary to our prior assumptions, prescription or medical information requirement, or the indication of contact information on the website, does not seem to correlate with \"rogue pharmacy\" status using the LegitScript online pharmacy verification standards. Instead, long-term continuous operation strongly correlated (P<.001) with explicit illegal activity.\nMost Internet pharmacies in our study sample were illegal sites within the definition of \"rogue\" Internet pharmacy. These websites violate professional, legal, and ethical standards and endanger patient safety. This work shows evidence that online pharmacies that act illegally appear to have greater longevity than others, presumably because there is no compelling reason for frequent change in order to survive. We also found that one in five websites revived (closed down and reopened again within four years) and no-prescription sites with limited medicine and patient information are flourishing.",

                "abstract": "This study was conducted in 1985 in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, 6 years after the closure of the state supported family planning services. Data from national surveys in 1977 and 1987 permit a comparison of sources of contraceptive supplies before and after the elimination of government support for family planning. The purchase of pseudo-abortifacients from private pharmacies was used as an indication of induced abortion. After the loss of government clinics, it is suggested that some women turned to pharmacists to obtain pseudo-abortifacients when faced with unwanted pregnancy. There is an indication of increased pseudo-abortifacient use, particularly among unmarried women and those from poorer neighbourhoods.\nThe hypothesis that a restriction of family planning services will be associated with an increased incidence of abortion was investigated in a survey carried out in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1985.  In 1979, the Government of Paraguay abruptly eliminated all support for family planning services at Ministry of Health clinics--a measure that affected at least half of all contraceptive acceptors and forced them to turn to pharmacies for contraceptive supplies.  The survey, which samples 10% of the registered private pharmacies in Asuncion, used the sale of pseudo- abortifacients as a measure of induced abortion.  Also interviewed were 56 contraceptive purchasers and 51 purchasers of injectables contraceptives intended for use as abortifacients who were recruited at the participating pharmacies.  The results indicated that low-income women were 5 times more likely than their higher income counterparts to purchase pseudo-abortifacients.  In addition, unmarried women were 3 times more likely to purchase progestogen injections to induce a missed menstrual period than married women.  Almost 70% of abortifacient purchasers reported that they had attempted to self-abort on previous occasions.  The pharmacists stated that up to 50 women a week requested medication for pregnancy termination and were in agreement that this practice had increased substantially following the government's withdrawal of support for contraception.  The pharmacists expressed concern about the nonavailability of counseling from trained family planning personnel and indicated that some pharmacy staff knowingly exploit women by injecting them with unsafe preparations or drugs that cannot induce abortion.  The administration of ineffective pseudo-abortifacients can delay the decision to seek an illegal abortion or result in life-threatening incomplete abortion.",

A total of 136 Internet pharmacy websites were assessed and followed for four years. According to the LegitScript database, relevant characteristics such as longevity, time of continuous operation, geographical location, displayed contact information, prescription requirement, medical information exchange, and pharmaceutical legitimacy verification were recorded and evaluated.\nThe number of active Internet pharmacy websites decreased; 23 of 136 (16.9%) online pharmacies ceased operating within 12 months and only 67 monitored websites (49.3%) were accessible at the end of the four-year observation period.

Data from national surveys in 1977 and 1987 permit a comparison of sources of contraceptive supplies before and after the elimination of government support for family planning. The purchase of pseudo-abortifacients from private pharmacies was used as an indication of induced abortion. After the loss of government clinics, it is suggested that some women turned to pharmacists to obtain pseudo-abortifacients when faced with unwanted pregnancy. There is an indication of increased pseudo-abortifacient use, particularly among unmarried women and those from poorer neighbourhoods.\nThe hypothesis that a restriction of family planning services will be associated with an increased incidence of abortion was investigated in a survey carried out in Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1985.  In 1979, the Government of Paraguay abruptly eliminated all support for family planning services at Ministry of Health clinics--a measure that affected at least half of all contraceptive acceptors and forced them to turn to pharmacies for contraceptive supplies.  The survey, which samples 10% of the registered private pharmacies in Asuncion, used the sale of pseudo- abortifacients as a measure of induced abortion.  Also interviewed were 56 contraceptive purchasers and 51 purchasers of injectables contraceptives intended for use as abortifacients who were recruited at the participating pharmacies.  The results indicated that low-income women were 5 times more likely than their higher income counterparts to purchase pseudo-abortifacients.  In addition, unmarried women were 3 times more likely to purchase progestogen injections to induce a missed menstrual period than married women.  Almost 70% of abortifacient purchasers reported that they had attempted to self-abort on previous occasions.  The pharmacists stated that up to 50 women a week requested medication for pregnancy termination and were in agreement that this practice had increased substantially following the government's withdrawal of support for contraception.  The pharmacists expressed concern about the nonavailability of counseling from trained family planning personnel and indicated that some pharmacy staff knowingly exploit women by injecting them with unsafe preparations or drugs that cannot induce abortion.  The administration of ineffective pseudo-abortifacients can delay the decision to seek an illegal abortion or result in life-threatening incomplete abortion.",

Among them are numerous illegal websites selling medicine without valid medical prescriptions or distributing substandard or counterfeit drugs. Only a limited number of studies have been published on Internet pharmacies with regard to patient safety, professionalism, long-term follow-up, and pharmaceutical legitimacy verification.\nIn this study, we selected, evaluated, and followed 136 Internet pharmacy websites aiming to identify indicators of professional online pharmacy service and online medication safety.\nAn Internet search was performed by simulating the needs of potential customers of online pharmacies. A total of 136 Internet pharmacy websites were assessed and followed for four years. According to the LegitScript database, relevant characteristics such as longevity, time of continuous operation, geographical location, displayed contact information, prescription requirement, medical information exchange, and pharmaceutical legitimacy verification were recorded and evaluated.\nThe number of active Internet pharmacy websites decreased; 23 of 136 (16.9%) online pharmacies ceased operating within 12 months and only 67 monitored websites (49.3%) were accessible at the end of the four-year observation period. However, not all operated continuously, as about one-fifth (31/136) of all observed online pharmacy websites were inaccessible provisionally. Thus, only 56 (41.2%) Internet-based pharmacies were continuously operational. Thirty-one of the 136 online pharmacies (22.8%) had not provided any contact details, while only 59 (43.4%) displayed all necessary contact information on the website. We found that the declared physical location claims did not correspond to the area of domain registration (according to IP address) for most websites. Although the majority (120/136, 88.2%) of the examined Internet pharmacies distributed various prescription-only medicines, only 9 (6.6%) requested prior medical prescriptions before purchase. Medical information exchange was generally ineffective as 52 sites (38.2%) did not require any medical information from patients. The product information about the medicines was generally (126/136, 92.6%) not displayed adequately, and the contents of the patient information leaflet were incomplete in most cases (104/136, 76.5%). Numerous online operators (60/136, 44.1%) were defined as rogue Internet pharmacies, but no legitimate Internet-based pharmacies were among them. One site (0.7%) was yet unverified, 23 (16.9%) were unapproved, while the remaining (52/136, 38.2%) websites were not available in the LegitScript database. Contrary to our prior assumptions, prescription or medical information requirement, or the indication of contact information on the website, does not seem to correlate with \"rogue pharmacy\" status using the LegitScript online pharmacy verification standards. Instead, long-term continuous operation strongly correlated (P<.001) with explicit illegal activity.\nMost Internet pharmacies in our study sample were illegal sites within the definition of \"rogue\" Internet pharmacy. These websites violate professional, legal, and ethical standards and endanger patient safety. This work shows evidence that online pharmacies that act illegally appear to have greater longevity than others, presumably because there is no compelling reason for frequent change in order to survive. We also found that one in five websites revived (closed down and reopened again within four years) and no-prescription sites with limited medicine and patient information are flourishing.",

The changes in etiology and demographic of the disease, which now includes also a large proportion of iatrogenic conditions, has prompted new studies and updates in the guideline for IE treatment. The increasing use of intravascular and intracardiac devices has introduced new challenges in terms of both antibiotic resistance and surgical treatment of prosthetic endocarditis. Also, patients with complex congenital heart diseases, intravenous drug abusers and patients with chronic renal failure under hemodialysis have been added to the list of high-risk subjects for IE. Important aspects concerning the establishment of the endocarditis team, the clinical management, the optimal medical therapy and the indication and timing for surgery are arguments of debate and controversy across the literature. In particular, the most adequate strategy to be adopted in the context of concomitant neurological complication remains greatly debated. Despite attempts to standardize the practice in IE, the lack of powered randomized clinical evidence prevented the achievement of a univocal consensus in several aspects of the management of IE. This situation reflects in some differences in the recommendation promoted by the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. In this review, we will compare the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines and discuss important aspects related to clinical management and indications of for treatment.",

According to the recently updated guidelines, IVT should be administered in absence of absolute exclusion criteria. We aimed to assess the proportion of ischemic strokes potentially eligible and actually treated with IVT, and to explore the reasons for not administering IVT. We prospectively collected and analyzed data from 1184 consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to the 22 Stroke Units (SUs) of the Veneto region from September 18th to December 10th 2017. Patients were treated with IVT according to the current Italian guidelines. For untreated patients, the reasons for not administering IVT were reported by each center in a predefined model including absolute and/or relative exclusion criteria and other possible reasons. Out of 841 (71%) patients who presented within 4.5\u00a0h of stroke onset, 704 (59%) had no other absolute exclusion criteria and were therefore potentially eligible for IVT according to the current guidelines. However, only 323 (27%) patients were eventually treated with IVT. Among 861 (73%) untreated patients, 480 had at least one absolute exclusion criterion, 283 only relative exclusion criteria, 56 only other reasons, and 42 a combination of relative exclusion criteria and other reasons. Our study showed that only 46% (323/704) of the potentially eligible patients were actually treated with IVT in the SUs of the Veneto region. All healthcare professionals involved in the acute stroke pathway should make an effort to bridge this gap between eligibility and reality.",

                "abstract": "Infective endocarditis (IE) represented over the last year a growing medical and surgical concern. The changes in etiology and demographic of the disease, which now includes also a large proportion of iatrogenic conditions, has prompted new studies and updates in the guideline for IE treatment. The increasing use of intravascular and intracardiac devices has introduced new challenges in terms of both antibiotic resistance and surgical treatment of prosthetic endocarditis. Also, patients with complex congenital heart diseases, intravenous drug abusers and patients with chronic renal failure under hemodialysis have been added to the list of high-risk subjects for IE. Important aspects concerning the establishment of the endocarditis team, the clinical management, the optimal medical therapy and the indication and timing for surgery are arguments of debate and controversy across the literature. In particular, the most adequate strategy to be adopted in the context of concomitant neurological complication remains greatly debated. Despite attempts to standardize the practice in IE, the lack of powered randomized clinical evidence prevented the achievement of a univocal consensus in several aspects of the management of IE. This situation reflects in some differences in the recommendation promoted by the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology. In this review, we will compare the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines and discuss important aspects related to clinical management and indications of for treatment.",

                "abstract": "Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is the treatment of choice for most patients with acute ischemic stroke. According to the recently updated guidelines, IVT should be administered in absence of absolute exclusion criteria. We aimed to assess the proportion of ischemic strokes potentially eligible and actually treated with IVT, and to explore the reasons for not administering IVT. We prospectively collected and analyzed data from 1184 consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to the 22 Stroke Units (SUs) of the Veneto region from September 18th to December 10th 2017. Patients were treated with IVT according to the current Italian guidelines. For untreated patients, the reasons for not administering IVT were reported by each center in a predefined model including absolute and/or relative exclusion criteria and other possible reasons. Out of 841 (71%) patients who presented within 4.5\u00a0h of stroke onset, 704 (59%) had no other absolute exclusion criteria and were therefore potentially eligible for IVT according to the current guidelines. However, only 323 (27%) patients were eventually treated with IVT. Among 861 (73%) untreated patients, 480 had at least one absolute exclusion criterion, 283 only relative exclusion criteria, 56 only other reasons, and 42 a combination of relative exclusion criteria and other reasons. Our study showed that only 46% (323/704) of the potentially eligible patients were actually treated with IVT in the SUs of the Veneto region. All healthcare professionals involved in the acute stroke pathway should make an effort to bridge this gap between eligibility and reality.",
