Examples of such assumptions include: traversing the ontology graph ignoring relationship types using a naive algorithm will not lead to cycles (i.e. the ontology is a DAG); every referenced term is declared in the ontology (i.e. there are no dangling clauses).

An ontology is OBO Basic if and only if it has the following characteristics:
DAG
Unidirectional
No Dangling Clauses
Fully Asserted
Fully Labeled
No equivalence axioms
Singly labeled edges
No qualifier lists
No disjointness axioms
No owl-axioms header
